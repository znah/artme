**Art Me Association**, a non-profit organization based in Switzerland, aims to discover innovative new art and introduce it to society. We promote and support emerging new generation artists and especially those working at the interfaces of generative art, artificial intelligence, photography and digital imaging.  Our artists use these techniques to reveal extraordinary inspiration, emotion, spirituality, beauty and mystery in a variety of mediums.

**Art Me** aspires to introduce art where everyone can find a personal response and reflection in his or her own soul, discover fascination in versatile aspects of life and human nature, where the boundaries are extended and the mind is open.  

**Art Me** is open to cooperation with various art market players in Switzerland and abroad for the involvement in diverse art projects.
